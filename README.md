# Space Competition
Our goal is to make bots that compete in a [physics-based war game](https://kevinbacabac.github.io/SpaceComp/index.html) using Javascript! You will develop the strategy your bot will use to conquer the stars.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop an understanding of intermediate Javascript. This includes using a JSON-based API, learning about classes, and much more!

- Become confident in your ability to develop Javascript programs

## Tools and Technologies

[Javascript] as the language of choice.
[HTML5 Canvas] as our visualizer.

Luckily if you have a web browser you're done setting up your environment!
